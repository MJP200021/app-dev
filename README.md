**# JIGSAW**
*My favorite Movie*
**Jigsaw**is a super spooky movie! It's part of the **"Saw"** series, and it's the eighth one. The story is about scary murders that seem like the work of Jigsaw, even though he's supposed to be dead. There are lots of puzzles and traps, making it a really exciting and kinda scary movie that keeps you guessing. If you like mysteries and a bit of a fright, you might enjoy **Jigsaw**
